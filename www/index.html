<h1>KAYAK GLOBE</h1>

<p>
KAYAK GLOBE is a prototype web component developed by 
<a href="http://ech.net">James Echmalian</a> for
<a href="http://www.kayak.com">kayak.com</a>.
</p>

<h2>What does it do?</h2>

<p>
The component displays and animates a globe.  The globe can turn on its axis.
Its attitude and tilt may be adjusted, as can its apparent distance from the
viewer. 
</p>


<h2>How is it implemented?</h2>

<p>
The Flash component is implemented in
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/actionscript/articles/actionscript3_overview.html">ActionScript 3.0</a>.
</p>

<p>
Various libraries, tools and utilities play a part in the implementation:

<li>The <a href="http://wiki.papervision3d.org">PaperVision 3D</a>
graphics library is used to render the bitmapped sphere.</li>

<li>Some components make use of the 
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flex">Adobe Flex</a>
development tools and component library.</li>

<li>The <a href="http://blog.deconcept.com/swfobject">SWFObject utility</a>
handles Flash Player version detection and Flash object embedding.</li>
</p>

<h2>Any special requirements?</h2>

<p>Because of its reliance on ActionScript 3.0, the globe requires Flash
Player 9.0 or beyond to run.</p>

<p>You must enable Javascript to access some features.</p>

<h2>Can I see it now?</h2>

This web page demonstrates a fully integrated GLOBE application.
The animation and user interaction may be used as the basis for a "quiz game"
application and possibly for others as well.
